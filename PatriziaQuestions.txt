Line 24:

Why ATLAS too? and others?

R/. Because ATLAS and CMS are the two main experiments that will cited in the document. ATLAS will be cited many times regarding the analyses looking for a T', and compared to CMS results. 

Line 34-35:

The standard model predicts a cross section of top-Higgs production, then any enhancement of their associated production will be a clear signature of physics beyond the standard model. 

R/. The following phrase is added: In addition, the existence of physics beyond the standard model can also be reflected by resonances that decay into a top-quark and a Higgs boson. 

Line 39:

I also discuss the formulation of an extension model of the standard model.

R/. "extension model" changed for "extension": I also discuss the formulation of an extension of the standard model.

Line 44:

This top partner is a new particle very similar to the standard model top-quark, but much heavier, that decays preferentially into a top quark and a Higgs boson.

R/. Removing the word preferentially: This top partner is a new particle very similar to the standard model top-quark, but much heavier, that can decay into a top quark and a Higgs boson.

Line 47:

Marked "standard model" in the phrase: The analysis looks for this particle in the full hadronic final state, where the Higgs boson decays into two b-quarks and the top quark decays into three standard model quarks, a b and two light quarks.

R/. I used "standard model quarks" in the phrase to avoid any confusion with the vector like quarks.

Line 161: 

On the other hand, in the search for the fundamental components of matter the periodic table has been constructed. -> Constructed?

R/. Changing the word constructed: On the other hand, in the search for the fundamental components of matter the periodic table has been formulated.

Line 162-163:

But even deeper in matter structure a set of fundamental particles, without known inner structure, have been also found. -> Up to now

R/. Changing phrase for: But even deeper in matter structure a set of fundamental particles, without known inner structure up to present, have been also found. 

Line 176:

Replace "However" with "Even if"

R/. "However it is a very big and complex machine" changed for "Even if it is a very big and complex machine"

Line 213: 

Replace "At" with "In"

R/. "At ancient Greece these theories were elaborated from a philosophical point of view." replaced by "In ancient Greece these theories were elaborated from a philosophical point of view."

Line 222:

Replace "This" with "The"

R/. "This SM relies on two of the more elegant constructs of modern physics and mathematics." replaced by "The SM relies on two of the more elegant constructs of modern physics and mathematics."

Line 224:

Replace "has" by "is"

R/. "Quantum field theory~\cite{RevModPhys.13.203} has born from the understanding of processes that take place at very small spatial scales and in a regime where special relativity plays an important role." replaced by "Quantum field theory~\cite{RevModPhys.13.203} is born from the understanding of processes that take place at very small spatial scales and in a regime where special relativity plays an important role."


Line 249:

Correct "does" with "do"

R/. "From the very beginning of physics, one of the most fundamental questions has been how does bodies interact" replaced by "From the very beginning of physics, one of the most fundamental questions has been how do bodies interact"

Line 257:

Replace "to describe" with "in describing"

R/. "The very precise and complete description of electromagnetism developed by Gauss, Faraday, Amp\`{e}re and finished by Maxwell succeeded to describe electricity and magnetism under the formalism of only one interaction within the mathematical formalism of classical fields." replaced by "The very precise and complete description of electromagnetism developed by Gauss, Faraday, Amp\`{e}re and finished by Maxwell succeeded in describing electricity and magnetism under the formalism of only one interaction within the mathematical formalism of classical fields."

Line 391:

Replace "SM" with "Standard Model (SM)"

R/. The abbreviation was defined in line 218 at the beginning of the chapter. 

Line 393:

Add "an"

R/. "The electromagnetic interaction has associated electric charge." changed by "The electromagnetic interaction has an associated electric charge."

Line 395:

Replace "the" with "called"

R/. "Finally, the strong force charge is the color." replaced by "Finally, the strong force charge is called color."

Line 396: 

Why 5 and not 6 fundamental bosons?

R/. I didn't count W^{+/-} as two bosons but as one. This also I used to count leptons, electron and positron as one and not two, and so on.

Line 424:

Add "experimental observations"

R/. "it leaves some unsolved puzzles in the heart of the SM." replaced by "it leaves some unsolved puzzles in the heart of the SM from experimental observations."

Line 475:

Symmetrical?

R/. "The final state is stable but not symmetrical." replaced by "The final state is stable but it is not symmetric under rotations around the z-axis."


Line 476:

Not clear

R/. "This transition also decreased the potential energy of the system, driving the system to its ground state." replaced by "This change of state also decreased the potential energy of the system, driving the system to its ground state."

Line 488-489:

Not clear

R/. "In order to avoid this problem a spin-0 field should be used. In addition, this field should be electrically neutral to avoid having a charged vacuum." replaced by "In addition, this field should be electrically neutral to avoid having a vacuum with a non-zero electrical charge."

Line 522:

Replace "in" with "of"

R/. "However some aspects of the model are not completely understood." replaced by "However some aspects in the model are not completely understood."

Line 533,534,544:

Too simplistic, not introduced before

R/. The following phrase is removed: However the real relevance or significance of this problem at theoretical level has been discussed extensively, the majority of the community agrees there is something to be understood on the subject. 

Line 553:

Not clear

R/. "This represents for some theoreticians a problem itself: fine-tuning or naturalness." replaced by "This represents for some theoreticians a problem by itself, referred as fine-tuning or naturalness. The name fine-tuning refers to the need of choosing extremely tuned values for the parameters to adjust a model to the theoretical requirements Naturalness asks the justification of the specific values given to parameters in a fine-tuned model."

Line 554:

Correct "accordingly"

R/. "accordingly to different models" replaced by "according to different models"

Line 590:

Not "in the SM"

R/. "From last sections it has been shown how there are some parts in the SM that need further understanding." replaced by "From last sections it has been shown how there are phenomena not described by the SM that need further understanding."

Line 591:

Not clear

R/. "From such internal issues some further models/theories have been developed." replaced by "From such problems some further models/theories have been developed."

Line 601:

Set instead of bunch

R/. "In this section a bunch" replaced by "In this section a set"

Line 620:

Why top-like? introduce

R/. After revisiting the phrase I think actually calling all vector-like states "top-like" is not precise. Thus, I've removed the word "top-like" from the phrase.

Page 16:

"I think that they can have also other exotic charges. They can be more than 4?"

R/. Yes, I think in principle we can consider also electric charge as 8/3 or -7/3, but there is no reference to this type of partners in the references I have used for the thesis and the analysis.

Line 650:

Add an "s" after VLQ and change "as the SM top quark" for "as any SM quark"

R/. "VLQ can be produced singly or pairwise, as the SM top quark." replaced by "VLQ's can be produced singly or pairwise, as any SM quark."

Line 663:

Not clear

R/. "In particular the case where couplings to light generations are important has been considered for the present work." replaced by "In the present work, the case where the couplings of the \Tp~ to light generations are comparable to the third generation couplings has been considered."

Figure 1.7:

Correct T for T', and add a table with some numbers for the cross sections.

R/. T' notation has been corrected, and the table has been added.
