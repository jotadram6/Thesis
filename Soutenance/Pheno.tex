\begin{block}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}\tiny
\item Single produced \Tp~with mixings to light quark generations $\to$ Enhanced production cross section
\item Full hadronic channel:
  \begin{itemize}\tiny
  \item Difficult $\to$ huge backgrounds
  \item Highest number of expected events
  \item It is possible to reconstruct the \Tp~mass
  \item It needs techniques to choose the jets to reconstruct the \Tp
  \end{itemize}
\item $T'\to tH, tZ, bW$ and $Br(T'\to tH)=0.5$ $Br(H\to b\bar{b})=0.57$ $Br(t\to bq\bar{q}')=0.66$

\begin{block}{Strategy}
\begin{itemize}\tiny
\item Signal: 3 $b$-quarks and 2 light quarks $\to$ High b-jet multiplicity
\item Real Higgs boson and top quark in signal events
\item Method to have a good identification of the 5 jets coming from the \Tp:
\begin{itemize}\tiny
\item Tag b--jets and keep events with at least two.
\item b-jets pairs used to reconstruct the Higgs boson $\to$ ${\Delta R_{bb} <2.5}$ and pair with closest mass to the Higgs boson mass (125~\GeVcc)
\item b-jets removed from jets collection $\to$ jets pair with closest mass to the W-mass (80~\GeVcc) chosen to reconstruct the \W~boson 
\item Higgs and \W~boson jets removed from jet collection $\to$ the jet giving the closest mass to the top mass (172~\GeVcc), combined with W-jets, was used to reconstruct the top quark

\begin{itemize}\scriptsize
\item \textit{Cut 0}: At least 6 jets with ${p_T > 30}$~GeV/c are required. At least five jets within $|\eta|<2.5$ and at least one jet within $2<|\eta|<5$. The \Tp~decays into five central jets. One associated jet in the forward direction. \\
\textbf{Figure}: $\eta$ distribution of the forward jet produced in association with \Tp. Signal sample is normalized to theoretical cross section and to 20~$fb^{-1}$.
\item \textit{Cut 1}: ${p_{T}(j_{1})>150}$~GeV/c, ${p_{T}(j_{2})>80}$~GeV/c, ${p_{T}(j_{3,4})>60}$~GeV/c
\item \textit{Cut 2}: $H_{T}>630$~GeV/c with $H_{T}=\sum |p_{T}(j)|$\\
\textbf{Figure}: Total hadronic energy for backgrounds (stacked) and signal (over--imposed) normalized to 20~$fb^{-1}$ luminosity. $H_{T}$ is higher in signal than in background events.

\textbf{Figure}: Reconstructed Higgs candidate $p_{T}$ in the x axis and reconstructed top candidate $p_{T}$ in the y axis for backgrounds (left) and signal (right). Signal events have reconstructed Higgs and top with higher \pt~than backgrounds.
\item \textit{Cut 6}: Events with $2.2<\Delta R_{HW}<3.5$ were kept\\
\textbf{Figure}: $\Delta R$ between the reconstructed Higgs and \W~candidates for backgrounds (stacked) and signal (over--imposed) normalized to 20 $fb^{-1}$ luminosity. However signal and backgrounds have a mean value of $\Delta R_{HW}=3$, backgrounds tend to have lower values than signal, as well as larger tails.
