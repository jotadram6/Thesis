... when he came opposite Palodes, and there was neither wind nor wave, Thamus from the stern, looking toward the land, said the words as he had heard them: ``Great Pan is dead.'' Even before he had finished there was a great cry of lamentation, not of one person, but of many, mingled with exclamations of amazement. \\

After Buddha was dead, people\\
showed his shadow for centuries afterwards in a \\
cave,—an immense frightful shadow. God is dead:\\
but as the human race is constituted, there will\\
perhaps be caves for millenniums yet, in which\\
people will show his shadow.—And we—we have\\
still to overcome his shadow!\\
